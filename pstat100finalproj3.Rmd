# Step 3: Final Project Report

## 1.1 Data Analysis
Based on your research questions, dataset characteristics, and hypotheses, choose an appropriate analytical approach. This may involve statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, or in-depth exploratory data analysis using visualizations.

Clearly justify your chosen method(s) and explain how they address your research questions. Where applicable, discuss any assumptions made and their implications.

Possible Approaches:

Regression Analysis: To explore relationships between continuous response and explanatory variables.
Classification: For predicting categorical outcomes (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees).
Clustering: To identify natural groupings within the data.
Time Series Analysis: For analyzing data with temporal structure.
Hypothesis Testing: To statistically test assumptions about your data (e.g., t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA).
Exploratory Data Visualization: For uncovering patterns, trends, or anomalies through detailed graphical analysis.

## 1.2 Evaluation and Interpretation

• Use appropriate evaluation techniques based on your selected approach:
• For models, apply relevant performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, accuracy) and include diagnostics to assess validity and assumptions.
• For hypothesis testing, clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses, report p-values or confidence intervals, and interpret the results.
• For visualizations, provide thoughtful interpretation and explain how the visuals support your research findings.

## 1.3 Interpretation of Results

Clearly interpret the results of your models, drawing connections back to your hypotheses and research questions. Discuss any significant patterns, anomalies, or insights found in your analysis.

## 1.4 Visualization and Communication of Findings

Use clear and informative visualizations to support your analysis. Annotate visualizations and discuss their significance. Ensure all visualizations have captions, labels, and are well-documented.
