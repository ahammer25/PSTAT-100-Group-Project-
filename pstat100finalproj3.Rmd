# Step 3: Final Project Report

## 1.1 Data Analysis
Based on your research questions, dataset characteristics, and hypotheses, choose an appropriate analytical approach. This may involve statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, or in-depth exploratory data analysis using visualizations.

Clearly justify your chosen method(s) and explain how they address your research questions. Where applicable, discuss any assumptions made and their implications.

Possible Approaches:

Regression Analysis: To explore relationships between continuous response and explanatory variables.
Classification: For predicting categorical outcomes (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees).
Clustering: To identify natural groupings within the data.
Time Series Analysis: For analyzing data with temporal structure.
Hypothesis Testing: To statistically test assumptions about your data (e.g., t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA).
Exploratory Data Visualization: For uncovering patterns, trends, or anomalies through detailed graphical analysis.


## 1.2 Evaluation and Interpretation

• Use appropriate evaluation techniques based on your selected approach:
• For models, apply relevant performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, accuracy) and include diagnostics to assess validity and assumptions.
• For hypothesis testing, clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses, report p-values or confidence intervals, and interpret the results.
• For visualizations, provide thoughtful interpretation and explain how the visuals support your research findings.

## 1.3 Interpretation of Results

Clearly interpret the results of your models, drawing connections back to your hypotheses and research questions. Discuss any significant patterns, anomalies, or insights found in your analysis.

## 1.4 Visualization and Communication of Findings

Use clear and informative visualizations to support your analysis. Annotate visualizations and discuss their significance. Ensure all visualizations have captions, labels, and are well-documented.

# Final Report

### Abstract
Provide a brief summary of your analysis, key findings, and conclusions in a few sentences.

We are interested in exploring how different car attributes and features affect the way cars are priced. This dataset includes information like brand, model, fuel type, and size, which are important when it comes to a car’s value. These insights could help car sellers make better pricing decisions and assist buyers in understanding what features contribute most to a car’s market value. A potential implication is that we don't know the mileage of these cars from this dataset, which does have an impact on the pricing.

#Still needs Key Findings and conclusions 

### Introduction
Provide an overview of your dataset, including its source, variables, and the key questions and hypothesis you are investigating.
**About our Data**

**Data Name/Title**: Car Price Prediction Multiple Linear Regression
  
  **Author/Owner**: MANISH KUMAR
  
  **Date of Publication**: UPDATED 6 YEARS AGO
  
  **Publication Venue**: Kaggle
  
  **Retrieval Date**: 4/17/25
 
  **Link**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction

  **Variables**: car_ID, symboling, CarName, fueltype, aspiration, doornumber, carbody, drivewheel, eniginelocation, wheelbase, carlength, carwidth, carheight, curbweight, enginetype, cylindernumber, enginesize, fuelsystem, boreratio, stroke, compressionratio, horsepower, peakrpm, citympg, highwaympg,and price

**Key Questions and Hypothesis**
We are most curious to see how different vehicle characteristics affect price.

We are investigating which vehicle features are the most significant predictors of car price. We hypothesize that engine size and horsepower will be the strongest positive predictors of price.
We are also exploring how a car’s physical dimensions, specifically its length, affect its price. We hypothesize that longer vehicles will, on average, have higher prices compared to shorter vehicles.
Finally, we are examining whether there are statistically significant differences in car prices across body types (e.g., sedan, hatchback, convertible). We hypothesize that convertibles will have the highest average prices, while hatchbacks will have the lowest average prices.

### Data Processing
Describe the steps taken for data cleaning, handling missing values, and any necessary preprocessing. Mention any transformations or feature engineering applied to improve the model’s performance.

### Modeling Process

### Results
Present your key results, using visualizations and tables as needed.

### Interpretation
Discuss how your findings answer the research questions and address your hypotheses.

### Visualization and Communication
Include well-labeled and informative visualizations, with captions explaining their relevance. Ensure clarity and professionalism in all graphical elements.

### Conclusion and Recommendations
Summarize your key insights and provide actionable recommendations.Discuss any limitations of your analysis and suggest potential future directions.
